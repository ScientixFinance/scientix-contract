# scientix-contract

Scientix is a friendly fork of Alchemix on Binance Smart Chain. Scientix is committed to Alchemix's vision of giving users advances on yield farming via a synthetic token that represents a fungible claim on any underlying collateral.

Scientix has the same functionalities as Alchemix (depositing BUSD to borrow scUSD, transmuting scUSD to BUSD, liquidation, staking, etc.). The initial kind of collateral Scientix supports is BUSD. In the future, we may support other assets as well.
